# Sample Cordova Application for Clef Native

This project demonstrates how Clef Native's Cordova extension would work using
the accompanying extension.

> Since we haven't released the extension to NPM as of yet, you have to have the
> SDK plugin checked out at the same directory that this repository is checked
> out at so that they're immediate siblings in the file tree.

## Quick Start

cordova run ios --emulator     # For iOS
